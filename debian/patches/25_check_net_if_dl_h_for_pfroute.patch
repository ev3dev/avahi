Description: Fix build failure on GNU/Hurd
 The scenario is the following: in avahi-core, three different network
 interface backends,
 - iface-linux.c (compiled if linux/netlink.h is found)
 - iface-pfroute.c (compiled if net/route.h is found)
 - iface-none.c (compiled in the remaining cases)
 on Hurd, it finds net/route.h so it tries to compile the pfroute backend; the
 problem is that the backend uses net/if_dl.h and the rt_* network stuff,
 unavailable on the Hurd.
 The proposed patch extends the configure check for net/route.h by adding
 net/if_dl.h among the includes needed for the check, so it will pass if both
 net/route.h and net/if_dl.h are available.
